Create a split view of any two pieces of content. You can insert a video, image, shortcode, or post (including pages) into any of the 2 sides in a split view.

== Description ==

Create a split view and insert it anywhere in your WordPress site. This lets you compare two different types of content in an interactive split view. Split views can be dragged to display more of one side than the other.

Supports inserting Videos, Images, Shortcodes, even Posts or Pages! You can also change the color of the handle.

You can insert a split view in any page or post on your site by using the shortcode `[psview id="12"]` where the id parameter determines which split view to load. You can add multiple split views per page if you like.
